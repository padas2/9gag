00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,680
I'm starving.

480
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,180
Scott.

481
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,620
What are you talking about?

482
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,820
<font color="#ff00ff">(MUFFLED)</font> So...

483
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,160
what I'm saying is...

484
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,830
time works differently in the quantum realm.

485
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,590
The only problem is right now

486
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,190
we don't have a way to navigate it.

487
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
But what if we did?

488
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,230
I can't stop thinking about it.

489
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,300
What if we could somehow control the chaos...

490
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,740
and we could navigate it?

491
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,270
What if there was a way...

492
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,040
that we could enter the quantum realm

493
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,240
at a certain point in time...

494
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,870
but then exit the quantum realm

495
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,140
at another point in time?

496
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,210
Like...

497
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,410
- Like before Thanos.
- <font color="#138ce9">STEVE:</font> Wait.

498
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,210
Are you talking about a time machine?

499
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,150
No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine.

500
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,390
This is more like a...

501
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,290
Yeah. Like a time machine.

502
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,190
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

503
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,560
<font color="#ff00ff">(STAMMERS)</font> But I can't stop thinking about it.

504
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,760

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,930
some way... <font color="#ff00ff">(SIGHS)</font>

506
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,900
- It's crazy.
- <font color="#138ce9">NATASHA:</font> Scott.

507
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,270
I get emails from a raccoon...

508
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,070
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

509
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,340
So, who do we talk to about this?

510
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,630
Chow time!

511
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,230
Maguna.

512
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,770
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?

513
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,870
<i>Define "lunch"</i>

514
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,270
- <i>or be disintegrated.</i>
- Okay.

515
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,070
You should not be wearing that, okay?

516
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,640
That is part of a special anniversary gift

517
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,710
I'm making for Mom.

518
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,920
There you go. You thinking about lunch?

519
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,180
I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.

520
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,090
- No.
- That's what you want.

521
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,320
How did you find this?

522
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
- Garage.
- Really?

523
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,530
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

524
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,260
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

525
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,200
You like going in the garage, huh?

526
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,000
So does Daddy. <font color="#ff00ff">(GRUNTS)</font>

527
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,270
It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her.

528
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,240
So, I'm gonna...

529
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,160
<font color="#ff00ff">(STAMMERS)</font> No. We know what it sounds like.

530
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,260
Tony, after everything you've seen,

531
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,560
is anything really impossible?

532
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,630
Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck scale...

533
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,430
which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition.

534
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,800
Can we agree on that?

535
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,970
Thank you.

536
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,370
In layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.

537
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,700
- I did.
- No.

538
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,670
You accidentally survived. <font color="#ff00ff">(SIGHS)</font>

539
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,940
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

540
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,410
And now you wanna pull a... What do you call it?

541
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,650
A time heist?

542
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,020
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

543
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,320
Why didn't we think of this before?

544
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,950
Oh, because it's laughable. Because it's a pipe dream.

545
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,160
The stones are in the past.

546
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,560
We could go back, we could get them.

547
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,930
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.

548
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,200
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?

549
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,660
I don't believe we would.

550
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,200
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

551
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,100
However, high hopes won't help...

552
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,140
if there's no logical, tangible way

553
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,640
for me to safely execute said time heist.

554
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,610
I believe the most likely outcome

555
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,940
will be our collective demise.

556
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,680
Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.

557
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,480
All right? It means no talking to our past selves...

558
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,250
no betting on sporting events.

559
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,060
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

560
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,360
Are you seriously telling me

561
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,320
that your plan to save the universe...

562
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,060
is based on <i>Back to the Future?</i>

563
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,100
- Is it?
- No.

564
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,200
Good. You had me worried there.

565
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,360
'Cause that would be horseshit.

566
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,930
That's not how quantum physics works.

568

We have to take a stand.

569
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,040
We did stand. And yet, here we are.

And now, now we have a chance to bring her back...

to bring everyone back,

576
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,260
and you're telling me that you won't even...

That's right, Scott. I won't even.

Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

Except it was worse for me...

611

'cause I lost twice.

First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

613
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,670
and then, we all lost.

No one blamed you, Bruce.

I did.

For years, I've been treating the Hulk

like he's some kind of disease...

something to get rid of.

619

But then, I start looking at him as the cure.

620
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,550
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

621
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,360
I put the brains and the brawn together...

622
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,760

Best of both worlds.

- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

but that isn't true.

1029
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,570
Think about it. If you travel to the past...

1030
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,970
that past becomes your future...

1031

and your former present becomes the past...

with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.

1063
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,920

for "damn near been killed"

1065

Well, I haven't...

but I don't even know

1068

what the hell you're all talking about.

1069
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,570
Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles

for one round-trip each.

1071
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,570
And these stones have been

1072
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,840
in a lot of different places throughout history.

1073

1074
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:22,340
So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

1075
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,380

Correct.

1077
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,050

1082
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,170
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.

1083
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:52,170
Someone called it a stone before.

1084
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:56,680
Um, it's more of an angry sludge sort of a thing...

1085
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,450
so someone's gonna need to amend that

1086
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,950
and stop saying that.

1087
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:02,720
Here's an interesting story, though, about the Aether.

1088
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,750
My grandfather, many years ago...

1089
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:08,860
had to hide the stone from the Dark Elves.

1090
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:11,390
Ooh. <font color="#ff00ff">(CHUCKLES)</font> Scary beings.

1091
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:13,160
So, Jane, actually...

1092
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,430
Oh, there she is.

1093
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:19,870
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

1094
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:23,240
You know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time...

1095
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,640
and then the Aether stuck itself inside her...

1096
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,410
and she became very, very sick.

1097
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:30,580
And so I had to take her to Asgard,

1098
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:31,850
which is where I'm from...

1099
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,950
and we had to try and fix her.

1100
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,580
We were dating at the time, you see...

1101
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:39,290
and I got to introduce her to my mother...
